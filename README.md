</h2>

Learn the following:
1. Computer logic gates

These are used everywhere to define a logic.

2. Basics of C/C++ (Programming language)

Many programming languages are inspired by C so learning the basics is going to teach you everything needed to master anything else. And C++ is a “superset” of C with more features. Most of the syntaxes and stuff are the same. Learning either will do your job!

3. Data Structures & Algorithms

Which can be learned using any language, aldo C/C++ is recommended.

4. Regular expression (RegEx)

Mandatory to avoid writing inefficient code in most cases.

5. Source Code

Look at other project's source code and learn from it.

6. Casting

Obvious
